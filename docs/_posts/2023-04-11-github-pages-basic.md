## Creating a GitHub account

### How-To

It is quite easy to create a GitHub account. Just follow as described in ["GitHub Docs - Getting started with your GitHub account"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).

If you are not familiar with GitHub, then start from ["GitHub Skills"](https://skills.github.com/).

## Creating a GitHub Pages site

### How-To

Similar to creating a GitHub account, it is also quite easy. Just follow as described in ["GitHub Docs - Quickstart for GitHub Pages"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) or ["Creating a GitHub Pages site"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

NOTE: In case of GitHub free account, the repository for GitHub Pages must be set to **"public"**.

NOTE: The repository name for GitHub Pages must be **`<username>.github.io`**, which makes your GitHub Pages available at `https://<username>.github.io/`.

NOTE: After creating a new repository for GitHub Pages, it takes quite some time to publish your site. GitHub Docs says it can take up to 10 minutes, but it seems it takes more than 10 minutes. Maybe it happens only to me. :)
